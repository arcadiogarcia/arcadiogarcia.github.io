I am Arcadio Garcia, a software engineer at Microsoft. I work in Windows and in my free time I enjoy playing with both native (C#, C++) and web (JS, TS) technologies to experiment with multimodal input and create multi-device, cloud-based experiences.

This is my blog, where I write about tech and sideprojects.
