I am Arcadio Garcia, a software engineer at Microsoft. I work in Windows and in my free time I enjoy using native and web technologies to experiment with multimodal input and cross-device experiences. 
 
I am a self-starter, I believe in using the right tools for each job, I enjoy prototyping and exploring the intersection between what can be done (technology) and what should be done (user experience).
 
I believe that software products should be more malleable, interoperable and extensible, and we have only seen a glimpse of truly personal computing.

This is my blog, where I write about tech and sideprojects.
